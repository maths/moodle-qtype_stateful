Required things:

 - PHP 7.1, we use nullable type return values in some functions, could be
   stripped out from the code to make it work for older PHP but personnally
   I feel that those are worth it. Although, more in the documentation sense.

 - STACK v4.3 and especially the following things:
   1. /stack/utils.class.php :
     - maxima_string_to_php_string() and php_string_to_maxima_string()
       passing string values is important for us.
     - all_substring_strings() and eliminate_strings() parsing them from
       complex responses is also important.
     - list_to_array() we like lists.

   2. /stack/cas/ast.container.class.php :
     - We use these to validate and evaluate values.
     - the factory constructors
     - get_valid
     - get_evaluationform

   3. /stack/cas/ast.container.silent.class.php :
     - We use these to validate and evaluate values.
     - the factory constructors
     - get_valid
     - get_evaluationform

   4. /stack/cas/secure_loader.class.php :
     - We cache much of validation of static logic content and load them as is.
     - get_evaluationform

   5. /stack/cas/cassession2.class.php
     - Evaluation is being done with the normal sessions.

   6. stack_options is also used.

 - There now exits a unit-test-set on the STACK side to check if STACK changes
   the names of things Stateful relies on.
